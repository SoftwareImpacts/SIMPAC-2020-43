## General Information

<b>PULsE</b> (<b>P</b>rocessing <b>U</b>nit for <b>L</b>aser fla<b>s</b>h <b>E</b>xperiments) is an advanced analysis program for processing data from laser flash experiments, allowing effective treatment of difficult cases where conditions may not be ideal for simpler analysis. PULsE analyses the heating curves, calculates and outputs the thermal properties of the sample, such as the thermal diffusivity, based on the inverse solution of a heat transfer problem. The software is specifically tailored for use in the Materials Research Facility at UKAEA, and reads standard ASCII files generated by the Linseis LFA systems; it was initially designed to read custom file formats from a different apparatus designed at the Moscow Engineering and Physics Institute. It is therefore inteded for use with any LFA instruments as an alternative to the standard, often simplistic software.

## Feature requests and collaboration

Please do contact me via [email](artem.lunev@ukaea.uk) in case if you are interested in new features, such as new input file formats, new heat transfer models, or anything related to the modification of the GUI or internal code structures. Anyone wanting to contribute to the code development are cordially welcome to make thoughtful commits to the repository! Those will be reviewed promptly.  

## Build instructions

* The first step is to clone the project files to your filesystem. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. Type `$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY` in Terminal to populate your current directory with the project sources files;
* Staying in the same directory, you should see the `pom.xml` file. This is used by Maven to build the binaries. You will need to have [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html) installed in order to proceed, as well as the [Java Development Kit 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). After you have installed both, type `mvn install` in the directory where you've cloned the PULsE source files. The dependencies are managed automatically with the info contained in the `pom.xml` file, so you don't need to do anything else;
* This will produce a `/target/` subdirectory with the `.jar` file and the `/target/lib/` folder. These can be copied to wherever location you prefer, as long as they stay in the same directoryl
* Allow the `.jar` file to be executable (e.g. on Linux) and double-click in order to run. If nothing happens, type `java -jar <NAME_OF_JAR>.jar`, replacing the <NAME_OF_JAR> with the appropriate file name. This should start the PULsE graphical interface.

## Buy me a coffee

I really enjoyed working on this open source project. In my opinion, this type of distribution fits very well with the spirit of science. PULsE will always be free to download and use. If you feel that this project deserves your support, please consider buying me a coffee by following the link below:
