# PULsE

PULsE (Processing Unit for Laser flaSh Experiments)  is an advanced analysis program for processing data from laser flash experiments, allowing effective treatment of difficult cases where conditions may not be ideal for simpler analysis.  PULsE analyses the heating curves from laser flash experiments and outputs the thermal properties of the sample.  PULsE is specifically tailored for use in the Materials Research Facility, and reads ASCII files generated by the Linseis LFA.

PULsE is written by Dr. Artem Lunev, contactable via email: artem.lunev@ukaea.uk.
