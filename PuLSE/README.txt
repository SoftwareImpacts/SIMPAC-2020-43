PULSE (Processing Unit for Laser flaSh Experiments), v. 1.0 FINAL BETA++ 

PULSE uses advanced numerical techniques based on finite difference schemes and nonlinear optimization to process data from laser flash experiments, allowing effective treatment of difficult cases such as high heat losses for samples with low thermal conductivity, noisy data when temperature detection is faulty, and thick samples, where radial heat fluxes affect the time-temperature distribution in the samples. The software then extracts the thermal properties of the sample, which include thermal diffusivity and integral emissivity. If specific heat and density data (normally, from calorimetry and dilatometry) is loaded, thermal conductivity can be calculated as well.

Latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run PULSE. This can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre8-downloads-2133155.html

How to use: Download the .jar file and simply double-click it to run the program. 

Test files are provided in two folders in this directory.

More detailed instructions will be published soon.
