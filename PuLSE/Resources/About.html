<p style="text-align: left;">Date of release: 02/09/2019<br /> Development: <a href="mailto:name@email.com">Dr. Artem Lunev &lt;artem.lunev@ukaea.uk&gt;</a><br /> Beta testing: Rob Heymer</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><br />PULsE uses advanced numerical techniques based on finite difference schemes and nonlinear optimization to process data from laser flash experiments, allowing effective treatment of difficult cases such as high heat losses for samples with low thermal conductivity, noisy data when temperature detection is faulty, and thick samples, where radial heat fluxes affect the time-temperature distribution in the samples. The software then extracts the thermal properties of the sample, which include thermal diffusivity and integral emissivity. If specific heat and density data (normally, from calorimetry and dilatometry) is loaded, thermal conductivity can be calculated as well.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">This software has been specifically tailored for use in the Materials Research Facility. It can read ASCII file formats generated by the Linseis LFA. Please contact the developer for more integration options for your equipment.</p>
