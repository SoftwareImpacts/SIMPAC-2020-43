/** This package deals with anything associated with finite differences in PULsE, 
 * including the definition of {@code Grid}s, which define the partitioning rules for space 
 * and time variables, the discretised {@code Pulse} on any of those grids, and 
 * finite-difference schemes, which subclass {@code DifferenceScheme}. The latter operate
 * using the {@code Solver} interface.
